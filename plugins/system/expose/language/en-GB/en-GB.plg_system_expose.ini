PLG_SYSTEM_EXPOSE_DOMAIN_LABEL="Local domain"
PLG_SYSTEM_EXPOSE_DOMAIN_DESC="<p>The plugin will only take effect when the site is accessed through this local domain. If you local site is accessible as <code>http://localhost/joomlasite</code> use <code>localhost</code> here. If you local site is accessible as <code>http://example.local.dev/joomlasite</code> use <code>example.local.dev</code> here.</p><p>This is meant as a fast failsafe. If you forget to unpublish the plugin before transferring your site to a live server it will remain inert.</p>"

PLG_SYSTEM_EXPOSE_ONLY_INTERNAL_LABEL="Only for private network IPs"
PLG_SYSTEM_EXPOSE_ONLY_INTERNAL_DESC="<p><strong>Very strongly recommended</strong> to leave enabled at all times.</p><p>Instructs the plugin to only take effect when the site is being accessed through a domain name that resolves to a private network or host loopback IP address. Basically, if your domain name resolves to a public IP address the plugin will take no effect.</p>"
